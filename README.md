# batch2-BLU12-instructors

## What is in this BLU?

In this final BLU in the Recommender Systems (RS) specialization we learn taxonomy and strategies to extend the algorithms and techniques learned so far. We also learn about evaluation metrics and Surprise, for fast prototyping. Finally, we zoom in on building RS based on implicit feedback and unary data. Good luck!
